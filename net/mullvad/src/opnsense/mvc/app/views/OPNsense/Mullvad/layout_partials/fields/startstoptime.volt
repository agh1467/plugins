{#
 # This is a partial for an 'onoff' field, which is very similar to a radio button
 # with the 'button-group' built-in style, however, only includes two pre-defined
 # buttons: On, Off
 #
 # Example Usage in an XML:
 #  <field>
 #      <id>status</id>
 #      <label>dnscrypt-proxy status</label>
 #      <type>status</type>
 #      <style>label-opnsense</style>
 #      <labels>
 #          <success>clean</success>
 #          <danger>dirty</danger>
 #      </labels>
 #  </field>
 #
 # Example Model definition:
 #  <status type=".\PluginStatusField">
 #      <configdcmd>dnscryptproxy state</configdcmd>
 #  </status>
 #
 # Example partial call in a Volt tempalte:
 # {{ partial("OPNsense/Dnscryptproxy/layout_partials/fields/status",[
 #     this_field':this_field,
 #     'field_id':field_id
 # ]) }}
 #
 # Expects to be passed
 # field_id         The id of the field, includes model name. Example: settings.enabled
 # this_field       The field itself.
 # this_field.style A style to use by default.
 #
 # Available CSS styles to use:
 # label-primary
 # label-success
 # label-info
 # label-warning
 # label-danger
 # label-opnsense
 # label-opnsense-sm
 # label-opnsense-xs

{# Original div used input-group class, but this causes z-index issues with the dropdown menu
   appearing behind boxes below it. So it's been removed. #}
{# These <select> elements will trigger dropdown boxes getting added. #}
                            <select
                                class="selectpicker form-control"
                                data-width="55"
                                data-size="10"
                                data-live-search="true"
                                id="{{ ids[0] }}"
                            ></select>
{# The setFormData() assumes all <selects> are backed by an array datatype like an OptionField type in the model.
   When retreiving the data through the search API, it expects to receive an array. That array should
   be the OptionValues described in the model. It will then sift through the array, and locate any
   with the selected=>1 and mark them as such. When this field is erroneously backed by a
   non-array type field, it results in one option being added to the list:
   # <option value="resolve" selected="selected"></option>
   This is a result of a "bug" in jQuery in the .each() function. Attempting to iterate through
   an empty string will result in only the word 'resolve' being returned.
   The following javascript code demonstrates this behavior:
   #  var r = 0;
   #  var str = '';
   #  for (r in str) {
   #     console.log(r);
   #  } #}
                            <select
                                class="selectpicker form-control"
                                data-width="55"
                                data-size="10"
                                data-live-search="true"
                                id="{{ ids[1] }}"
                            ></select>
                        </div>
                    </td>
{%          endfor %}
                </tr>
            </table>
{%      endif %}
